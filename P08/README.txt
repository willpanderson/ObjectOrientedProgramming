Directions for using the software for whomever it may concern. 


1. When the program opens, the sensitivity is set to the client mode. 
     
    To access the diffrent levels, select Role>(Client,Staff,Manager,Director) and enter in the respective password

    Client: No password here, automatically set when button is clicked
    Manager: "manager"
    Staff: "staff"
    Director "director"

2. The undo function only works to remove animals and clients at this moment, I was unable to sucessfully complete 
   the undo for adopted animals. 

3. The staff class is unfinished and I was unable to implement it into my software. I have included the classes.

4. There are several files that can be used as test cases for file handling included.
